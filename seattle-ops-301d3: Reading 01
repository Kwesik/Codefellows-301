While reading about the difference between Windows and a Windows server.  When I used to think of a server I would think of a rack holding multiple units with maybe an interface
that resembled powershell or some form of commandline.  With no experience working with a server it was interesting to learn that upon starting both systems that would look similar
A Windows server has its major function in it's name so it's not suprising that is is used to profide difference services for it's users.  I believe what is interesting is the different
roles a server can take on in a company.  Expense being an important decision making component for many business and it's very important to take that into concideration when advising a
company on what hardward is best for their needs and budget.
